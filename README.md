Gameplay Mechanics
Score points by getting the ball past opponent's paddle

Ball speed increases after paddle collisions

Random ball direction on serve

First to 15 points wins (as shown in screenshot)

Technical Implementation
Object-Oriented Design:

Ball class handles movement and collisions

Paddle base class with player/CpuPaddle specialization

Collision Detection:

Circle-Rectangle collision for ball-paddle interaction

Wall bouncing physics

AI System:

CPU paddle follows ball's Y-axis position

Predictive movement algorithm

Future Improvements
